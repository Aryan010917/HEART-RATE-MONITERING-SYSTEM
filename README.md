# HEART-RATE-MONITERING-SYSTEM
With rising interest in fitness, monitoring heart health during workouts is vital. We built a Heart Rate Monitor using a Pulse Sensor, Arduino Uno, and 16x2 LCD with I2C to display real-time BPM. It helps avoid risks like dizziness by tracking heart rate accurately. Ideal for personal and educational use.
